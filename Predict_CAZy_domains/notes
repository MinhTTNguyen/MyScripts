======================================================
CHANGE IN SCRIPT step1_read_hmmscan_dbCAN_cutoff.pl
======================================================

First line in the output from the script "step1_read_hmmscan_dbCAN_cutoff.pl" SHOULD NOT HAVE '#' at the beginning:
#Seq_id CAZy_family     Evalue  HMM_fraction    HMM_from        HMM_to  HMM_len Domain_from     Domain_to       Seq_len

because when input this output file into R, this line is not regconized as the header.

Hence, I changed the script so that the first line in the output file is:
Seq_id CAZy_family     Evalue  HMM_fraction    HMM_from        HMM_to  HMM_len Domain_from     Domain_to       Seq_len


For previous CaZyme prediction work, there should be no problem from the above issue since the scripts in step3 (combining results from dbCAN'HMMs and in-house HMMs) removed the '#' in the first line in the output files
